                <p>What would you do if you are given a task in which you have to run a particular block of code multiple times in your program. Don't you think so that being a programmer it would sound very lame to write that particular block of code multiple times in the same program. So here come the concept of functions, to reduce your efforts.</p>
    
                <h2>What is a function?</h2>
                <p>So a function is basically a block of code which is used to perform a particular task multiple times. It is based on the concept of write once and use many times.</p>
    
                <h2>Advantages of functions</h2>
                <p>There are mainly two advantages of JavaScript functions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Code reusability: We can call a function several times so it save coding.</li>
                    <li>Less coding: It makes our program compact. We donâ€™t need to write many lines of code each time to perform a common task.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
    
                <h2>Syntax for functions in Javascript</h2>
                <p>While using a function we need to keep two main things in mind:</p>
                <h3>1. Function Definition</h3>
                <p>In javascript a function is defined using the keyword <strong>function</strong> followed by the function name and a parentheses '( )'.<br> These parentheses can either be empty or can contain parameters based upon your program. <br>Then comes the program body which is written inside curly brackets.</p>
                <h3>2. Function Calling</h3>
                <p>To call / invoke a function in the your program, you simply need to write the name of that function as shown in the following code.</p>
                <h2>Functions With Arrguments</h2>
                <p>Javascript allows us to pass different parameters while calling a function. These passed parameters can be captured inside the function and any manipulation can be done over those parameters. A function can take multiple parameters separated by comma.</p>
    
                <h2>Functions with return statements</h2>
                <p>When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing. If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement. Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller": </p>
    
                <p> A JavaScript function can have an optional return statement. This is required if you want to return a value from a function. This statement should be the last statement in a function. For example, you can pass two numbers in a function and then you can expect the function to return their multiplication in your calling program.</p>
               
                <h2>Scope of Function</h2>
                <p>Variables defined inside a function cannot be accessed from anywhere outside the function, because the variable is defined only in the scope of the function. However, a function can access all variables and functions defined inside the scope in which it is defined.<br> In other words, a function defined in the global scope can access all variables defined in the global scope. A function defined inside another function can also access all variables defined in its parent function, and any other variables to which the parent function has access.</p>
